## Abstract
We present a rigorous classical analysis of electromagnetic (EM) wave emission by the human body, focusing on the brain, heart, and spinal systems as current-carrying biological circuits. Using only Maxwell’s equations in free space, we show that the resulting EM fields at 1 m distance can, in principle, displace a test electron by hundreds of meters. This displacement arises without requiring resonance or coherence, and implies that neural and cardiac activity can affect external matter nontrivially. These results offer a strict physical foundation for interpreting telepathy and telekinesis as emergent classical electromagnetic phenomena.

## One-sentence summary:

## 1. Introduction

This work presents a rigorous Maxwellian analysis of electromagnetic (EM) emission from the human body. We start by stating the conclusions drawn from this study, then develop the theoretical framework and calculations supporting them.

The approach is strictly classical, with no additional assumptions beyond Maxwell’s equations in free space. We aim to provide a firm, physics-based foundation for the idea that the human body generates EM fields sufficient to affect other matter at a distance—offering a theoretical grounding for telepathy and telekinesis, understood as classical EM phenomena.

## 2. Main Conclusion

* The human body, modeled as an ensemble of current-carrying biological circuits (neurons, heart, spine), emits electromagnetic waves.

* These waves produce an oscillating electric field at 1 meter distance with sufficient amplitude to move a test electron in vacuum by hundreds of meters.

* This displacement arises solely from Maxwellian fields; no resonance or coherence assumptions are necessary.

* Larger particles, including individual light atoms (e.g., hydrogen, carbon, oxygen) present in the brain and body, experience proportionally smaller but still non-negligible displacements (microns to centimeters).

* The biological emission results from coordinated signal patterns between brain and heart circuits acting as coupled electromagnetic sources.

* Space is filled with energy and behaves as a dielectric medium, enabling propagation and interaction of these fields with matter.

* Consequently, the human EM field acts as a real, physically effective carrier capable of interacting with external systems and potentially influencing neural and molecular activity.

## 3. Biological Circuits as Electromagnetic Antennae

### 3.1 Neurons as Conducting Tubes

* Each neuron’s axon conducts ionic currents during action potentials, approximating a cylindrical conductor.

* Typical current magnitude:

  $$
  I_{\text{axon}} \sim 1\, \mu\text{A}
  $$

* Axon length can reach up to approximately 1 m, acting as a biological antenna.

* Synchronous neuronal assemblies act collectively as phased arrays, amplifying emitted fields.

### 3.2 The Heart as a Dipole Source

* The heart operates as a rotating current dipole, generating stronger EM fields.

* Typical current amplitude:

  $$
  I_{\text{heart}} \sim 1\text{–}5\, \text{mA}
  $$

* Frequency approximately 1 Hz.

* The heart’s EM emission dominates the cardiac magnetic field detected externally.

### 3.3 Brain–Heart–Spine Circuitry

* The human body’s nervous and circulatory systems form coupled current loops.

* Integrated currents combine to produce composite EM emissions:

  $$
  I_{\text{human}} \sim 1\text{–}10\, \text{mA}
  $$

* Coordinated signaling between brain and heart establishes complex, time-varying EM patterns.

* This global circuit effectively acts as a low-frequency antenna.

## 4. Electromagnetic Field at 1 Meter

### 4.1 Radiated Power Estimate

Using the electric dipole radiation formula:

$$
P = \frac{\mu_0 I_0^2 L^2 \omega^4}{12\pi c}
$$

Assuming:

* $I_0 = 1\, \text{mA}$
* $L = 1\, \text{m}$
* $f = 10\, \text{Hz} \Rightarrow \omega = 2\pi \times 10\, \text{rad/s}$

Computes to:

$$
P \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-13}\, \text{W}
$$

### 4.2 Electric Field Amplitude

Power density at 1 m distance:

$$
S = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2} \approx 8.8 \times 10^{-15}\, \text{W/m}^2
$$

Electric field amplitude (vacuum impedance $Z_0 = 377\, \Omega$):

$$
E = \sqrt{2 Z_0 S} \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-6}\, \text{V/m}
$$

## 5. Electron Displacement by EM Field

The force on a free electron is:

$$
F = -e E_0 \cos(\omega t)
$$

Equation of motion:

$$
m_e \ddot{x} = -e E_0 \cos(\omega t)
$$

Solution amplitude:

$$
x_{\max} = \frac{e E_0}{m_e \omega^2}
$$

Numerical values:

* Electron charge $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}$
* Electron mass $m_e = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{kg}$
* Angular frequency $\omega = 2\pi \times 10\ \text{rad/s}$
* Field amplitude $E_0 = 8.1 \times 10^{-6} \text{V/m}$

Results in:

$$
x_{\max} \approx 360\, \text{m}
$$

## 6. Mass-Dependent Displacement of Matter

For a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$, displacement scales as:

$$
x \sim \frac{q E_0}{m \omega^2}
$$

Example: individual light atoms present in the body and brain (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen), typical atomic mass on order of

$$
m_{\text{atom}} \approx 1\text{–}3 \times 10^{-26}\, \text{kg}
$$

Compared to the electron’s mass, about $3 \times 10^4$ times larger. Thus,

$$
x_{\text{atom}} \approx \frac{1}{3 \times 10^4} \times 360\, \text{m} \approx 1\, \text{cm}
$$

This displacement is non-negligible and implies biological EM fields could influence molecular and atomic structures at a distance.

## 7. Field Decay and Energy in Space

Space is not empty but filled with electromagnetic energy and behaves effectively as a dielectric medium, permitting propagation and interaction of biological EM fields with matter. Energy conservation forbids non-decaying or growing far fields in free space; instead, the EM waves radiate outward and interact with their environment.

## 8. Implications and Interpretation

* Biological EM emission is real and classically quantifiable.

* Despite weak power, field amplitudes are sufficient to physically displace charges and atoms at macroscopic distances.

* This supports the theoretical plausibility of telepathy and telekinesis as classical EM interactions.

* No quantum or exotic forces need be invoked.

* The human body generates an EM “field of thought” capable of propagating and interacting with other beings or objects.

## 9. Final Remarks

* This study is grounded solely in Maxwell’s classical electromagnetism in free space.

* Biological currents generate fields capable of macroscopic charge and atomic displacement and interaction.

* Coordinated brain-heart signaling creates complex EM patterns potentially relevant for information transfer.

* Further experimental investigation is required.

* This framework serves as a rigorous minimal foundation for exploring long-range electromagnetic effects in living systems.
