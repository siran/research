## Abstract
We show that three seemingly different processes — the $(1)$ mode of the Point–Not–Point (PNP) scalar field, biological breathing, and cortical world-modelling — share the same inversion topology.
Each is a self-contained loop in which part of the system’s own state is experienced, functionally, as “outside.”
We formalise this common structure as a phase inversion across a nodal surface, prove its continuity in the underlying state space, and discuss measurable implications for physics, physiology, and cognitive science.

## 1. Introduction
The PNP framework models all phenomena as oscillatory modes of a scalar energy field $U(x,t)$.
The simplest closed mode, $(1)$, flows inward, vanishes at a node, and re-emerges outward with opposite phase.
In vector space this appears as an orientation reversal; in phase space it is continuous.

We note the same inversion occurs in:
1. **Breathing** — inhalation/exhalation phases separated by pauses.
2. **Perception** — inward sensory flow producing an outward-experienced virtual world.

These are not analogies but instances of a **structural archetype**: a self-contained loop that projects a part of itself as external.

## 2. The $(1)$ Mode in PNP
Minimal mode:

$$
U(r, t) = A \sin(k r - \omega t), \quad kR = \pi
$$

Orientation vector:

$$
\hat{n}(r) = \frac{\nabla U}{|\nabla U|}
$$

Inversion at node:

$$
\lim_{r\to 0^-} \hat{n} = -\lim_{r\to 0^+} \hat{n}
$$

Continuous in $U$, discontinuous in $\hat{n}$.

## 3. Breathing as a Macroscopic $(1)$ Loop
Let $x(t)$ be lung volume; define $\dot{x}$ as flow.
Node: $\dot{x} = 0$ at full/empty lungs.
Inhale phase $\dot{x} > 0$, exhale phase $\dot{x} < 0$.
Inversion: change of sign in $\dot{x}$ at node, continuous in $x$.
Functionally identical to $(1)$: a closed flow with in–out reversal at null flow.

## 4. Cortical World-Modelling
Let $s(t)$ be sensory inflow; $m(t)$ the internal model state; $o(t)$ the experienced “outside world.”

Transformation:

$$
m(t+\Delta t) = F(m(t), s(t))
$$

Experience arises from $m(t)$, but is tagged as external:

$$
o(t) \equiv m(t) \quad \text{[external label]}
$$

Information flow is inward ($s(t)$) → model inversion at generative step → outward projection as perceived scene.
The “outer world” is an internally generated phase of the same loop.

## 5. Formal Archetype
Let $X$ be the system’s state space; $Z \subset X$ a nodal set where an orientation-like variable changes sign.
A $(1)$-type inversion satisfies:

1. Continuity in $X$ across $Z$.
2. Sign reversal of a projection $p(X)$ across $Z$.
3. Closure of trajectory in $X$.

All three cases — PNP $(1)$, breathing, cortical modelling — meet these conditions.

## 6. Implications
- **Physics**: $(1)$-type inversion is a primitive in scalar field dynamics.
- **Biology**: breathing is a macroscopic life-sustaining $(1)$ loop.
- **Cognition**: perception is a $(1)$ loop where “in” and “out” are interpretive phases of one flow.
- **Unification**: inversion loops appear at multiple scales because they are topologically minimal self-sustaining structures.

## 7. Conclusion
The $(1)$ mode’s in–out inversion is not limited to physics: it recurs in physiology and cognition.
This suggests it is a structural archetype of self-contained systems — a universal loop where the system projects part of itself as “outside.”
