## Abstract

We develop a second‐order relational description of the Point–Not–Point (PNP) scalar‐field framework, showing how “in” and “out” — along with orientation, direction, and spatial geometry — emerge from the self‐referential phase structure of a single real scalar field $U(x,t)$.
The minimal closed mode, $(1)$, exhibits Möbius‐like phase inversion across its nodal surface, sustaining continuous energy circulation without geometric twist.
This work complements our previously published *PNP Description of Energy Flow* and *PNP Theory of Gravitation*, providing a symbolic and conceptual formulation of PNP suitable for interpreting its physical content in broader foundational and philosophical contexts.

## 1 Introduction

In standard physics, space is treated as a container and orientation as a primitive.
In PNP, neither is fundamental: the only ontic entity is a scalar energy field $U:\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$.
Observable structure arises from $U$’s closed oscillations, with apparent directions and “in–out” relations emerging from nodal phase behavior.

Here we show how the minimal $(1)$ mode defines a self‐referential energy flow that reverses orientation across a node without spatial inversion, grounding spatial concepts in scalar recursion.

## 2 Scalar field recursion

The field dynamics are given by

$$
F = d(*dU), \quad dF=0, \quad d*F=0
$$

from which electric‐ and magnetic‐like fields follow:

$$
\mathbf{B} = *\,dU, \quad \mathbf{E} = *\,d*\,dU
$$

These satisfy the source‐free Maxwell equations.
In PNP, they are not primary: they are projections of the scalar’s own oscillatory recursion.

## 3 Minimal mode and in–out reversal

Define the minimal spherical standing wave:

$$
U(r,t) = A\sin(k r - \omega t), \quad U(0,t) = U(R,t) = 0
$$

The boundary condition gives

$$
k R = \pi
$$

The field flows inward, cancels at $r=0$, and reemerges outward with opposite phase.

Let

$$
\hat{n}(r) = \frac{\nabla U}{|\nabla U|}
$$

Then

$$
\lim_{r\to 0^-} \hat{n} = -\lim_{r\to 0^+} \hat{n}
$$

This inversion is continuous in phase space but appears as a reversal in vector space — a Möbius‐like effect in the field’s orientation.

## 4 Second‐order relationality

PNP’s relationality is two‐tiered:

1. **First‐order:** Spatial relations arise from field phase gradients.
2. **Second‐order:** Those gradients are themselves defined by other relations — internal phase continuity across nodes.

“In” and “out” are thus not absolute directions but phase‐dependent projections.
Space itself is the stable pattern of these relations.

## 5 Implications

- Orientation is emergent, locally reversible, and defined only via field phase.
- “In” and “out” are not ontic — they are relational descriptors of recursion.
- Geometry and topology are epistemic models of field closure, not fundamental givens.
- Complex structure results from nested and interacting closed modes.

## 6 Conclusion

The minimal $(1)$ mode in PNP provides a self‐referential energy flow that defines “in” and “out” without presupposing space or orientation.
This complements the formal derivation of PNP’s dynamics and its gravitational application, offering a compact conceptual lens for interpreting the framework’s physical and philosophical reach.
