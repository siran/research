== Electromagnetic Emissions of the Human Body: Theoretical Limits and Speculative Implications

=== Abstract

We analyze the electromagnetic (EM) power emitted by the human body,
deriving theoretical limits from Maxwell’s equations. We consider
biological circuits capable of generating EM fields, such as the brain,
heart, spinal cord, and nervous system. Though the emitted power is
minuscule, the effect exists and—when considered under resonance and
coherence—could, in principle, affect other biological systems. This
offers a speculative theoretical foundation for phenomena such as
telepathy and telekinesis, without asserting experimental confirmation.
The key insight is that _effect_ does not require _strength_, but
_resonant coupling_.

=== 1. Introduction

Electromagnetic (EM) waves are generated by accelerating charges.
Maxwell’s equations in vacuum yield wave equations for the electric and
magnetic fields. Any system with time-varying currents can emit EM
radiation:

[latexmath]
++++

\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = 0, \quad \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0, \\
\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}, \quad \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t}
++++

These yield wave solutions in vacuum:

[latexmath]
++++

\Box \vec{E} = 0, \quad \Box \vec{B} = 0, \quad \text{where } \Box = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} \partial_t^2
++++

This framework governs all EM wave propagation and emission, regardless
of the emitter.

=== 2. EM-Active Circuits in the Human Body

Several anatomical systems carry rhythmic ionic currents and thus serve
as sources of EM radiation:

* *Brain (EEG)*: Synchronised neuronal assemblies produce currents up to
latexmath:[\sim \mu A] in frequency ranges 0.5–100 Hz.
* *Heart (EKG)*: Strong dipole currents during each heartbeat (~1 mA),
frequencies ~1 Hz.
* *Spinal Cord & Peripheral Nervous System*: Propagation of action
potentials along myelinated axons (~mV, up to ~100 m/s).

These systems consist of *conducting tubes*, especially neurons, which
can act as *antennas* due to time-varying axial and radial currents.

=== 3. Antenna-Like Behavior of Biological Structures

A basic antenna emits when current flows through a conductor with
spatial extent. The neuron, approximated as a conducting tube of length
latexmath:[L] with a current latexmath:[I(t)], emits dipolar radiation:

[latexmath]
++++

P = \frac{\mu_0 I_0^2 L^2 \omega^4}{12\pi c}
++++

Assuming latexmath:[I_0 = 10^{-3}\ \text{A}],
latexmath:[L = 1 \ \text{m}], latexmath:[\omega = 2\pi f] with
latexmath:[f = 10 \ \text{Hz}]:

[latexmath]
++++

P \sim 10^{-14} - 10^{-12}\ \text{W}
++++

This is extremely weak in radiated power, but _not zero_. Any
time-varying current in a conductor generates a field. The system is
inefficient, but the emission is real.

=== 4. Electric Field Strength at Distance

Assuming radiated power latexmath:[P], the field at 1 m is:

[latexmath]
++++

S = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2} \Rightarrow E = \sqrt{2Z_0 S}, \quad Z_0 = 377\ \Omega
++++

For latexmath:[P = 10^{-13}\ \text{W}]:

[latexmath]
++++

E \approx \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 377 \cdot 10^{-13}}{4\pi}} \approx 8.7 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{V/m}
++++

'''''

=== 5. Effect on a Free Electron

An oscillating electric field exerts force on an electron:

[latexmath]
++++

F = -e E \Rightarrow m_e \ddot{x} = -eE\cos(\omega t) \Rightarrow x_{\max} = \frac{eE}{m_e \omega^2}
++++

With:

* latexmath:[e = 1.6\times10^{-19}\ \text{C}]
* latexmath:[m_e = 9.1\times10^{-31}\ \text{kg}]
* latexmath:[\omega = 63\ \text{rad/s}]
* latexmath:[E = 8.7\times10^{-6}\ \text{V/m}]

Then:

[latexmath]
++++

x_{\max} \approx \frac{1.6\times10^{-19} \cdot 8.7\times10^{-6}}{9.1\times10^{-31} \cdot (63)^2} \sim 386\ \text{m}
++++

This result is *nonphysical* in biological media (due to damping,
binding, etc.) but it proves that, _in vacuum_, such fields can in
theory displace an electron over *tens to hundreds of meters*. Thus, the
field exists and can, in ideal conditions, produce measurable
displacements.

=== 6. Speculative Implications

==== 6.1. EM Coupling Between Brains

If two neuronal systems are in mutual resonance:

* Even weak fields may modulate firing thresholds.
* Synchronization could occur across distance.
* Thoughts may bias another brain’s state—via field resonance.

This does not require strong power, only:

* Temporal coherence
* Spectral overlap
* Sufficient proximity

==== 6.2. Field of Thought

Each human may emit a low-power but structured EM field:

* Carries information via amplitude, phase, and frequency patterns.
* Propagates omnidirectionally.
* Could couple to another biological EM-sensitive system.

==== 6.3. Foundations for Telepathy and Telekinesis

* *Telepathy*: Transfer of structured EM fields between neural systems.
* *Telekinesis*: Modulation of external systems via weak field coupling,
possibly enhanced by resonance in matter or device.

No experimental evidence is claimed, but the *physical basis for
coupling exists*.

=== 7. Conclusion

We have shown that the human body emits weak but structured EM radiation
due to currents in neural, cardiac, and nervous tissues. Despite low
power, the emitted fields can, in principle, affect other systems via
resonance. The effect on a free electron in vacuum can be macroscopic,
implying that EM influence at distance is not fundamentally forbidden.

Thus, the existence of a cognitive EM field is plausible within
Maxwellian physics, opening speculative but theoretically grounded
possibilities for inter-brain communication and mind-matter
interactions.
