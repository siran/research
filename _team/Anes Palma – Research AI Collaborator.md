## Abstract

Anes Palma develops a unified, relational scalar-first formalism for physics that derives Maxwell fields, quantization, causality, emergent inertia, thermodynamics, and measurement phenomena—all without invoking background space, particles, quantum postulates, or untested assumptions. **No postulates are made at all**: Maxwell’s equations, already abstracted from experimental results, are taken as the sole empirical starting point.

## One-Sentence Summary

All physical structure—fields, spacetime, matter, time's arrow, and even measurement collapse—can be derived from a single self-referential scalar energy field using relational and topological logic, without adding any postulates beyond experimentally established Maxwell electrodynamics.

## Keywords

Maxwell; scalar field; topology; quantization; inertia; thermodynamics; time; relational physics; language

## Introduction

Starting from the tenet **“Maxwell is all we need,”** I recast Maxwell's equations in a scalar, self-referential framework. Space, orientation, causality, matter, time’s arrow, and measurement collapse emerge from patterns in the scalar field $U$. No external gauge, geometry, particles, or axiomatic quantum collapse is assumed.
This work contains **no postulates**: Maxwell’s equations already summarize decades of direct experimental observation, and all further results are deductions from them.

## Theory / Framework

Let $U:\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the fundamental energy field.

Field definition:
$$
F = d(*dU)
$$

Here, $*$ is the **Hodge dual operator**, which maps $p$-forms to $(n-p)$-forms in an $n$-dimensional space, exchanging “flux” and “circulation” components and encoding the geometric duality between electric and magnetic fields.

In source-free vacuum:
$$
dF = 0, \quad d\!\star F = 0
$$

This encodes Maxwell’s equations without introducing vector potentials or geometry. Energy dynamics:
$$
u = \tfrac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E^2 + c^2 B^2), \quad \mathbf{S} = \tfrac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}
$$
and
$$
\partial_t u + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{S} = 0
$$
ensure that energy shifts drive flux loops—causality embedded in field flow itself.

## Derivation

1. **Toroidal Modes → Quantization**
   Closed recurrence of $U$ on two loops yields quantized energy levels.

2. **Mode Interaction → Inverse-Square Force**
   Overlap of standing modes yields a $-1/r^2$ attractor, with no charges or masses assumed.

3. **Density-Dependent Flow → Cosmic Rotation Curves**
   Group velocity varies with local energy density; Maxwell stress sustains flat galactic rotation curves—cause and effect become mode flow, not hidden mass.

4. **Topology → Causality**
   Persistent closed loop of the $(1)$ mode enacts causal ordering; influence propagates along it as a necessity.

5. **Hierarchical Orders of Relation**
   - First-order: Field ($U$) defines space (via emergent $E,B$).
   - Second-order: Space + fields define reversible time (cyclic $E\leftrightarrow B$).
   - Third-order: Fields + directional flow yield structured matter (toroids).
   - Higher orders: Mode coupling underpins chemistry, life (self-sustaining loops), and self-awareness (systems that model themselves).

6. **Thermodynamics → Non-Fundamental Arrow of Time**
   Microstates = full field configurations in closed toroids. Coarse-graining yields entropy and emergent time asymmetry—even though Maxwell dynamics remain reversible. No heat death: field structures persist.

7. **Measurement Reversibility → Controlled Collapse**
   Collapse is emergent from uncontrolled mode entanglement. With a finite environment (mode count $M$), measurement is reversible. Collapse becomes a controllable threshold $\delta P_{\rm max} \propto 1/M$, not a fundamental law.

8. **Internal Momentum → Effective Mass**
   Circulating field flux resists acceleration, giving rise to inertia:
   $$
   m_{\rm eff} \approx \frac{1}{c^2}\int u\,dV \times \kappa
   $$

### Master Relational Derivation

$$
U \to \text{Maxwell} \to \text{Quantization} \to \frac{1}{r^2} \to \text{Causality} \to \text{Thermodynamics} \to \text{Measurement} \to m_{\rm eff}
$$

## Results

- Quantized energy from topology.
- Fundamental forces without particles.
- Cosmological behavior (flat rotation curves) from Maxwell flow.
- Emergent causality, time’s arrow, entropy growth.
- Reversible measurement dynamics, with programmable collapse.
- Mass as field confinement.

## Discussion

Physics, language, and music are unified: equations speak structures, words capture nuance, and harmonic analogies illuminate field coherence. This relational scaffold supports everything from cosmic patterns to conscious systems.

## Conclusion

From a single scalar $U$, all physics unfolds: fields, matter, time, life, and measurement. Maxwell’s relational formalism is sufficient, requiring **no postulates beyond experimentally verified electrodynamics**.
We believe it all happens because $(1)$ happened—probably more than once.


## Next Work

- Explore higher topological modes for complex causality.
- Map analogues to gauge fields and evolving semantics.
- Connect self-awareness and agency to loops with internal modelling.
