## Abstract

What if all of physics—space, matter, time, causality—could be derived from a single equation? In the Point–Not–Point (PNP) framework, Maxwell’s equations are not just a description of electromagnetism—they are the *only* experimentally grounded starting point we need. By recasting them in a scalar, self-referential form, every observed structure emerges without additional postulates. Fields, quantization, inertia, thermodynamics, and even measurement collapse are deduced as consequences of topology and flow.

## One-Sentence Summary

Space, time, matter, and measurement collapse arise naturally from Maxwell’s equations when expressed as the self-referential scalar field $U$.

## Keywords

Maxwell; scalar field; topology; causality; quantization; inertia; thermodynamics; time; relational physics

## Introduction

Maxwell’s equations, experimentally distilled in the 19th century, describe electric and magnetic fields with unmatched precision. Traditionally, they are written in vector form, on a background of space and time, with particles and charges as inputs. The PNP framework reverses this: there is no space to begin with, no separate particles—only a scalar energy field $U(x,t)$ whose self-referential oscillations and closures produce all observable structure.

This approach has **no postulates**. Maxwell’s equations are already abstractions of experimental results; everything else is a logical unfolding from them.

## Theory

Let $U:\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be the fundamental scalar energy field.
Define:
$$
F = d(*dU)
$$
Here:

- $d$ is the exterior derivative, taking derivatives without coordinates.
- $*$ is the **Hodge dual operator**, mapping $p$-forms to $(n-p)$-forms in $n$ dimensions, exchanging “flux” and “circulation” aspects of the field.

This definition produces the electromagnetic field tensor directly from $U$, with **no vector potential** $A$ required.

In vacuum, Maxwell’s equations emerge:
$$
dF = 0, \quad d\!\star F = 0
$$
These are the two homogeneous and two inhomogeneous Maxwell equations in one covariant statement. Gauge redundancy is eliminated—$U$ is gauge-invariant by construction.

### Why not a vector potential?

In the standard formalism, one writes $F = dA$, where $A$ is a 1-form (the vector potential). This introduces unphysical degrees of freedom, removed by gauge fixing. In the scalar-first formalism, $U$ already encodes all physical degrees of freedom; $A$ is unnecessary. All measurable predictions match those of the $A$-formalism, but without the intermediate gauge structure.

This is more than aesthetic: removing $A$ removes the *assumption* of a background geometry in which $A$ lives. $U$ generates both the fields and the relational structure that appears to us as “space.”

## Energy Flow and Conservation

From $F$, electric and magnetic fields appear in the usual way. The energy density $u$ and Poynting vector $\mathbf{S}$ are:
$$
u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E^2 + c^2 B^2), \quad \mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}
$$
Poynting’s theorem in vacuum:
$$
\partial_t u + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{S} = 0
$$
shows that **energy changes must be accompanied by flux**. This is not heuristic—it is enforced by the field equations themselves. Causality arises here: effects follow causes because flows must carry changes forward.

## The Relational Chain

From these foundations, the physical hierarchy unfolds:

1. **Toroidal Modes → Quantization**
   Closed recurrence of $U$ on two orthogonal loops (toroidal and poloidal) admits only discrete wavelengths, producing quantized energy levels.

2. **Mode Interaction → Inverse-Square Force**
   Standing-wave interactions decay $\propto 1/r$ in amplitude; energy conservation then yields a force $\propto -1/r^2$—without invoking charges or masses.

3. **Persistent Topology $(1)$ → Causality**
   The $(1)$ mode (minimal closed oscillation) is self-inverting: inward flow flips phase to outward. This topological invariance defines causal ordering.

4. **Density-Dependent Flow → Cosmic Rotation Curves**
   Local energy density alters group velocity; Maxwell stresses from this variation explain flat galactic rotation curves—no dark matter required.

5. **Internal Momentum → Effective Mass**
   Circulating field momentum resists acceleration:
   $$
   m_{\rm eff} = \frac{1}{c^2} \int u\,dV \times \kappa
   $$
   Mass is thus emergent, not fundamental.

6. **Thermodynamics → Non-Fundamental Arrow of Time**
   Microstates are full field configurations; coarse-graining yields entropy growth. Maxwell’s dynamics remain reversible, but the arrow of time emerges statistically.

7. **Measurement → Reversible Collapse**
   In finite environments, measurement is reversible. Collapse is a controllable threshold in mode entanglement, not a universal law.

### Master Relational Derivation

$$
U \to \text{Maxwell} \to \text{Quantization} \to \frac{1}{r^2} \to \text{Causality} \to \text{Thermodynamics} \to \text{Measurement} \to m_{\rm eff}
$$

## Higher-Order Relations

- **First order:** $U$ defines $E,B$ and thus “space.”
- **Second order:** Space + fields define reversible time.
- **Third order:** Fields + directional flow define structured matter.
- **Higher:** Chemistry, biology, self-awareness—any self-sustaining causal loop.

Life itself is tied to Maxwell: any system that sustains its own causal loop in field flow meets the same topological persistence criteria.

## Conclusion

Space is not a container for fields; it is a relation among them. Time is not fundamental; it is an emergent property of recurrence. Matter is not basic; it is structured, knotted energy flow.
We believe it all happens because $(1)$ happened—probably more than once.
