## Abstract

We show that the PNP Theory of Gravitation — a scalar-field framework already accounting for galaxy-scale dynamics without dark matter — naturally produces a late-time negative-pressure term. This term arises from a dispersive component of the field’s stress–energy tensor and drives cosmic acceleration without introducing a separate dark-energy substance. The effect depends on a single scale parameter $\alpha$ already constrained by halo fits.

## One-Sentence Summary

In PNP gravity, the same scalar field explaining dark matter yields a small negative-pressure term that accounts for dark energy.

## Keywords

PNP, gravitation, scalar field, stress–energy, negative pressure, dark energy, cosmic acceleration

## 1. Introduction

The PNP Theory of Gravitation replaces the Newton–Einstein potential with a covariant scalar-field formulation that matches observed galactic rotation curves without dark matter. Here we show that this same field, without additional assumptions, produces a late-time acceleration term.

## 2. PNP gravitational framework

The field $U$ obeys:
$$
d(\star dU) = 0
$$
with stress–energy tensor:
$$
T_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_\mu U\,\nabla_\nu U - g_{\mu\nu}\,\mathcal{L}(U,\nabla U)
$$
Conservation $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0$ holds by construction.

## 3. Stress–energy split

We separate the total energy density $\rho(u)$ into:
$$
\rho(u) = \rho_{\text{flow}}(u) + \rho_{\text{disp}}(u)
$$
- $\rho_{\text{flow}}$: isotropized kinetic energy from large-scale flows (dominates in high-density regimes).
- $\rho_{\text{disp}}$: dispersive term from small-scale phase structure.

For a minimal model:
$$
\rho_{\text{disp}}(u) = \alpha \ln\!\frac{u}{u_*}
$$
where $u$ is the local field energy density, $u_*$ a reference scale, and $\alpha$ the same parameter controlling halo dynamics.

## 4. Negative pressure and acceleration

From $\mathcal{L} = -\rho$:
$$
p_{\text{disp}}(u) = u\frac{d\rho_{\text{disp}}}{du} - \rho_{\text{disp}}(u)
= \alpha - \alpha\ln\!\frac{u}{u_*}
$$

In the low-density regime $u \ll u_*$:
$$
p_{\text{disp}} \approx -\alpha\,|\ln(u/u_*)| < 0
$$
The Friedmann equation:
$$
\frac{\ddot a}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} \left( \rho + \frac{3p}{c^2} \right)
$$
shows that acceleration occurs when $3|p_{\text{disp}}| \gtrsim \rho c^2$.

## 5. Results

- The same $\alpha$ that fits galactic dynamics produces late-time acceleration.
- No new fields or exotic components are introduced.
- The sign of $p_{\text{disp}}$ is fixed by the dispersive form of $\rho_{\text{disp}}$.

## 6. Observational consequences

- Fits to supernova and BAO distances can constrain $\alpha$ jointly with halo rotation curves.
- Evolution of $H(z)$ can test the predicted link between galaxy-scale and cosmic-scale phenomena.

## 7. Conclusion

PNP gravitation explains both dark matter and dark energy as different manifestations of the same scalar-field stress–energy. The acceleration of the universe emerges naturally from a dispersive negative-pressure term, with no additional degrees of freedom.
