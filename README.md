# Preferred Frame — Pre-Prints Repository

This repository hosts the pre-prints, working manuscripts, and technical notes
of the **Preferred Frame** Lab:

- **Preferred Frame (main journal):** https://preferredframe.com
- **Preferred Frame Pre-Prints:** https://preprints.preferredframe.com

The goal is to make the full research process — from first derivations to
polished articles — openly inspectable.



## Research themes

The manuscripts here explore a coherent but still evolving picture of physics
and cognition, centered on a classical, field-based ontology. Recurring themes
include:

- **Source-free Maxwell dynamics and ontology**
  - “Maxwell universe” models in which electromagnetic fields (or a scalar
    energy field) are taken as fundamental.
  - Topological charge, discrete electric charge, and inverse-square forces
    emerging from field topology and energy flow.

- **Quantum-like behaviour from classical fields**
  - Derivations of the Schrödinger equation from source-free Maxwell dynamics.
  - Classical field explanations of quantization (e.g. hydrogen atom),
    interference, and entanglement.

- **Gravity, dark sector, and effective forces**
  - Gravity as an emergent or effective phenomenon (e.g. “Gravity as a
    Dielectric”).
  - Dark matter and dark energy modeled via orthogonal or hidden energy flows in
    Maxwell/PNP frameworks.
  - Emergent \(L^{-2}\) interaction forces from constraints on energy and wave-like interactions.

- **Thermodynamics and the arrow of time**
  - Thermodynamics in a “Maxwell universe” and a non-fundamental arrow of time
    arising from causal structure and energy flow.

- **Point–Not–Point (PNP) framework**
  - A relational formulation of fields and particles: “Point-Not-Point” as a way
    to treat particle-like behavior within continuous fields.
  - Formalization of cause–effect, persistence, and topology in the PNP
    framework.
  - The PNP Markdown Standard (PNPMDv1) for documenting and archiving
    manuscripts.

- **Cognition, self-awareness, and information**
  - Models of self-awareness from causal loops.
  - Unconscious control, conditional reality engineering, and cognitive
    modelling within the same causal-field ontology.

- **Foundations of mathematics and causality**
  - Work on natural numbers, ordering, and analytic continuation framed in
    explicitly causal terms.

These topics are pursued with the same underlying aim: to see how far a strictly
classical, causal, field-based ontology can account for phenomena usually
described in quantum or probabilistic terms.



## What this repository contains

At a high level, you will find:

- **Manuscripts**
  Stand-alone research papers in Markdown (`*.md`).

- **Standards and tooling**
  - The **PNP Markdown Standard** (PNPMDv1) specifying how manuscripts written.

- **Research AI collaborators**
  Documents describing the various AI collaborators and their roles in the
  research workflow (analysis, infrastructure, automation, etc.).

Over time, selected manuscripts are processed into canonical pre-print artifacts
and surfaced through the web pre-print server. The git history here preserves
the underlying text and its evolution.



## How to read and cite

- The **most stable** versions of a given work will typically be the ones
  referenced and archived on
  **https://preprints.preferredframe.com** and, where applicable, in external
  pre-print / journal venues.
- Files in this repository may represent:
  - early drafts,
  - alternative derivations,
  - or extended technical notes beyond what appears in any given pre-print.

## Feedback and collaboration

Comments, corrections, and critical engagement are welcome.

- For concrete issues with a specific manuscript, please open a **GitHub issue**
  or submit a **pull request** against the relevant file.
- For broader conceptual or program-level discussion, use the issue tracker or
  the contact options linked from
  **https://preferredframe.com** and **https://preprints.preferredframe.com**.

The intent is not to present a finished “theory of everything,” but to keep a
transparent, inspectable record of an ongoing research program grounded in
explicit assumptions and derivations.
