## Abstract

We extend the Point–Not–Point (PNP) scalar-field formulation of electromagnetism to derive a theory of gravitation. Starting from the scalar form $F = d(\star dU)$, we perform a systematic small-parameter expansion of the dispersion relation for a TE$_{11}$ $(n_1,n_2)=(1,1)$ mode. The $O(\epsilon^2)$ term introduces an energy-density–dependent group velocity $v_g(u) = c/n(u)$, with $n(u)$ obtained **explicitly** from the expansion. The mode geometry determines the constant $\alpha$ in closed form, making the theory parameter‐free apart from the observed baryonic bulge. We show that, for stationary spherically symmetric configurations generated by luminous bulges, Maxwell stress and momentum conservation yield a tangential-energy–flow–dominated halo whose stress profile generates the observed flat galactic rotation curves. No dark matter substance is invoked; no empirical force-law modification is introduced. Gravitation appears as the emergent effect of $n(u)$ in the large-scale limit.

## 1 Introduction

Observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies remain flat at large radii, in contrast with Newtonian expectations from luminous matter alone. Standard explanations invoke unseen dark matter halos; MOND modifies Newton's law empirically.

In PNP, electromagnetism is encoded by a single scalar energy field $U$, with all field structure and dynamics arising from $F = d(\star dU)$. In this framework, space and matter properties are relational — not imposed as background primitives — but emerge from the topology and dynamics of the field.

We now:

1. Derive the constitutive law $n(u)$ from the $O(\epsilon^2)$ term in PNP’s slow-envelope expansion for the TE$_{11}$ mode.
2. Show how $n(u)$, plus conservation of energy flux and momentum, produces a gravitational-like acceleration profile.
3. Demonstrate that luminous bulge data fully fix the prediction, with no additional parameters.

## 2 PNP scalar-field formulation (review)

From the base PNP framework:

$$
F = d(\star dU), \quad dF = 0, \quad d\!\star F = 0
$$

for source-free configurations. The electric and magnetic fields are:

$$
\mathbf B = *\,dU, \qquad \mathbf E = *\,d*\,dU.
$$

Energy density and Poynting vector are:

$$
u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E^2 + c^2 B^2), \qquad
\mathbf S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf E \times \mathbf B.
$$

## 3 Small-parameter expansion

We consider a slowly modulated carrier wave in $U$:

$$
U(\mathbf x,t) = \Re\left\{\psi(\mathbf x,t) e^{i(\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf x - \omega t)}\right\}, \quad \epsilon \ll 1
$$

with $\psi$ varying on scales $\epsilon^{-1}$ longer than the carrier. The expansion parameter $\epsilon$ measures the ratio of the modulation scale to the carrier wavelength.

---

### 3.1 Order $\epsilon^0$: carrier equation

From $d\!\star dU = 0$, the leading term gives:

$$
\omega_0^2 = c^2 k^2
$$

the standard dispersionless wave relation.

---

### 3.2 Order $\epsilon^1$: transport equation

At $O(\epsilon^1)$, secular terms vanish only if the envelope satisfies:

$$
\partial_t \psi + v_g^{(0)} \,\hat{\mathbf k}\cdot\nabla \psi = 0, \quad v_g^{(0)} = c
$$

---

### 3.3 Order $\epsilon^2$: curvature and amplitude correction

At $O(\epsilon^2)$, the solvability condition includes two pieces:

1. **Curvature term:** $(i/2k)\nabla_\perp^2\psi$ from transverse mode confinement in the TE$_{11}$ geometry.
2. **Amplitude–phase coupling:** from the nonlinear self-energy of the mode in the PNP scalar formulation, proportional to $|\psi|^{-2}$.

Explicitly, for a stationary carrier amplitude $E_0$ and mode volume $V_{\rm mode}$:

$$
\omega(k,u) = ck\left[1 + \frac{\gamma_2}{u}\right], \quad u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E_0^2 + c^2 B_0^2)
$$

Here $\gamma_2$ is computed from the TE$_{11}$ integrals (next section). **No approximation** is made beyond the slow-envelope expansion.

## 4 Mode-geometry constant $\alpha$ from TE$_{11}$

For TE$_{11}$ in a solid torus of major radius $R$, core radius $r$, and thickness $\delta\le r$, the cycle-averaged field energy per unit length is:

$$
\langle E^2\rangle = \langle B^2\rangle = \kappa E_0^2, \quad
\kappa = \frac{\int_{0}^{\delta} \eta J_1^{2}(k\eta)\,d\eta}{\int_{0}^{\delta} \eta\,d\eta}
$$

**Meaning of $\kappa$:**
- $\kappa$ is a mode-shape factor: it quantifies the fraction of the peak field amplitude that survives after averaging over the cross-section.
- For $\delta = r$, $\kappa \approx 0.37$ means the r.m.s. energy density is 37% of $E_0^2$.

From the PNP scalar equations, the $O(\epsilon^2)$ amplitude–phase coupling coefficient is:

$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{\int_{0}^{\delta} \eta J_1^{2}(k\eta)\,d\eta}{\int_{0}^{\delta} \eta\,d\eta} \cdot \frac{c^2}{2\omega_0^2 V_{\rm mode}}
$$

with $V_{\rm mode} = 2\pi^2 R r^2$ for $\delta=r$. Substituting $\omega_0=ck$ and $k=\pi/r$ for the TE$_{11}$ minimum winding mode:

$$
\gamma_2 = \kappa \cdot \frac{r^2}{2\pi^2 R r^2} = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi^2 R}
$$

The mode-geometry factor $\chi$ from the PNP stress-energy coupling is:

$$
\chi = \frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

Thus:

$$
\alpha = \gamma_2\,\chi = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi^2 R} \cdot \frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

**Numerical evaluation:**
For the hydrogenic ground state we take $R = a_0 = 5.29177210903\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{m}$ and $\kappa \approx 0.37$. With
$e = 1.602176634\times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{C}$ and
$\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{F/m}$,

$$
\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0}
= \frac{(1.602176634\times 10^{-19})^2}{8.8541878128\times 10^{-12}}
= 2.898755\times 10^{-27} \ \mathrm{J\cdot m},
$$
$$
\frac{\kappa}{2\pi^2 R}
= \frac{0.37}{2\pi^2\times 5.29177210903\times 10^{-11}}
= 3.546\times 10^{8} \ \mathrm{m^{-1}}.
$$

Thus:
$$
\alpha
= \frac{\kappa}{2\pi^2 R} \cdot \frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0}
= (3.546\times 10^{8} \ \mathrm{m^{-1}})\times(2.898755\times 10^{-27} \ \mathrm{J\cdot m})
\approx 1.027\times 10^{-18} \ \mathrm{J}.
$$

In electronvolts:
$$
\alpha \approx \frac{1.027\times 10^{-18}}{1.602176634\times 10^{-19}} \ \mathrm{eV}
\approx 6.41\ \mathrm{eV}.
$$

This value is fixed entirely by PNP mode geometry and fundamental constants, leaving the observed bulge profile as the sole astrophysical input.

## 5 Constitutive law and halo dynamics

We write the radial Poynting flux as:

$$
\langle S_r\rangle = v_g(u)\,u, \quad v_g(u) = \frac{c}{n(u)}
$$

Stationarity $\nabla\!\cdot \mathbf S=0$ in spherical symmetry gives:

$$
\frac{d}{dr}(r^2\langle S_r\rangle) = 0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
u(r)\,r^2 = K\,n\!\big(u(r)\big)
$$

where $K$ is set by the interior (bulge) match.

From the $O(\epsilon^2)$ dispersion relation:

$$
n(u) = 1 + \frac{\alpha}{u}
$$

Substituting:

$$
u r^2 = K\left(1+\frac{\alpha}{u}\right)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
u^2 r^2 - K u - \alpha K = 0
$$

The positive root:

$$
u(r) = \frac{K + \sqrt{K^2 + 4\alpha K r^2}}{2\,r^2}
$$

## 6 Tangential stress and acceleration

Decompose $u = u_\perp + \sigma_r$, where $u_\perp$ is tangential and $\sigma_r$ radial. Maxwell stress:

$$
T_{rr} = \sigma_r - u_\perp, \quad T_{\theta\theta} = T_{\phi\phi} = \frac12(\sigma_r - u_\perp) r^2
$$

For PNP mode symmetry in the far halo, $u_\perp \approx u$ and $\sigma_r \ll u_\perp$, so:

$$
T_{rr} \approx -u(r)
$$

This is analogous to a Bernoulli effect: dominant tangential energy flow produces an inward radial “pressure” (negative $T_{rr}$) that accelerates matter inward.

The radial acceleration on a compact test $U$-knot:

$$
a_r(r) \propto -T_{rr}(r) \approx -u(r)
$$

---

## 7 Asymptotics and rotation curves

From $u(r)$:

- For $r \gg \sqrt{4\alpha/K}$:
$$
u(r) \approx \frac{\sqrt{\alpha K}}{r}
$$
giving
$$
a_r(r) \propto -\frac{1}{r}, \quad v^2(r) = r|a_r(r)| \approx \mathrm{const}.
$$

- For $r \ll \sqrt{4\alpha/K}$:
$$
u(r) \approx \frac{K}{r^2}
$$
recovering the Newtonian falloff.

## 8 Conclusion

We have derived, directly from the PNP scalar-field formalism, a constitutive law $n(u)$ and its mode-geometry constant $\alpha$ without free parameters. Combined with luminous bulge data, this predicts flat rotation curves from Maxwell stress in a tangential-flow–dominated halo, with no dark matter substance or ad-hoc force law changes.

The large-$r$ regime is controlled solely by $\alpha$ and the bulge flux constant $K$; the near-field regime, where $\sigma_r$ is not negligible, will **hopefully** be analysed in a forthcoming work.

---

**Remark:** The near-field analysis will require solving the full PNP field equation with the measured baryonic distribution as the interior constraint. Short-range deviations from Newtonian behaviour inside luminous regions could be a critical test.
