## Abstract

We extend the Point–Not–Point (PNP) scalar-field formulation of electromagnetism to derive a theory of gravitation. Starting from the scalar form $F = d(\star dU)$, we perform a systematic small-parameter expansion of the dispersion relation. The $O(\epsilon^2)$ term introduces an energy-density–dependent group velocity $v_g(u) = c/n(u)$, with $n(u)$ obtained explicitly from the expansion. We show that, for stationary spherically symmetric configurations generated by luminous baryonic bulges, Maxwell stress and momentum conservation yield a tangential energy–flow–dominated halo whose stress profile generates the observed flat galactic rotation curves. No dark matter substance is invoked; no empirical force-law modification is introduced. Gravitation appears as the emergent effect of $n(u)$ in the large-scale limit.

## 1 Introduction

Observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies remain flat at large radii, in contrast with Newtonian expectations from luminous matter alone. Standard explanations invoke unseen dark matter halos; MOND modifies Newton's law empirically. In PNP, electromagnetism is encoded by a single scalar energy field $U$, with all field structure and dynamics arising from $F = d(\star dU)$. Mass, charge, and even space emerge from the topology and dynamics of $U$.

In this work we:

1. Derive the constitutive law $n(u)$ from the $O(\epsilon^2)$ term in PNP’s small-envelope expansion.
2. Apply this to a stationary spherical halo generated by a luminous bulge.
3. Show that the tangential stress profile yields constant $v(r)$ at large $r$.

## 2 PNP scalar-field formulation (review)

From the base PNP framework:

$$
F = d(\star dU), \quad dF = 0, \quad d\!\star F = 0
$$

for source-free configurations. The electric and magnetic fields are:

$$
\mathbf B = *\,dU, \qquad \mathbf E = *\,d*\,dU.
$$

Energy density and Poynting vector are:

$$
u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E^2 + c^2 B^2), \qquad
\mathbf S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf E \times \mathbf B.
$$

## 3 Small-parameter expansion and dispersion

We introduce a slowly modulated carrier wave for $U$:

$$
U(\mathbf x,t) = \Re\left\{\psi(\mathbf x,t) e^{i(\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf x - \omega t)}\right\}, \quad \epsilon \ll 1
$$

with $\psi$ varying on scales $\sim \epsilon^{-1}$ longer than the carrier. Substitution into the scalar Maxwell equation $d\!\star dU=0$ yields, order-by-order in $\epsilon$:

- **$O(\epsilon^0)$:** Dispersionless wave equation $\omega = c k$.
- **$O(\epsilon^1)$:** First-order envelope transport equation (group velocity $c$).
- **$O(\epsilon^2)$:** Second-order term involving $\nabla^2\psi$ and amplitude-dependent phase corrections.

From the $O(\epsilon^2)$ solvability condition, the dispersion relation becomes:

$$
\omega(k,u) \approx c k\left(1 + \frac{\alpha}{u}\right)
$$

where $u = (\varepsilon_0/2)(E^2 + c^2B^2)$ is the local cycle-averaged energy density of the carrier mode, and $\alpha$ is a constant set by the mode’s topology (winding numbers $(n_1,n_2)$) and geometry (Appendix A). This is a **derived** result from the PNP scalar-field wave equation.

---

## 4 Constitutive law

From $\omega(k,u)$, the group velocity is:

$$
v_g(u) = \frac{\partial\omega}{\partial k} \approx c\left(1 + \frac{\alpha}{u}\right)
$$

Thus the **group index** is:

$$
n(u) \equiv \frac{c}{v_g(u)} \approx \frac{1}{1 + \alpha/u} \approx 1 - \frac{\alpha}{u} + O(\alpha^2/u^2)
$$

For small $\alpha/u$ the inverse form is:

$$
n(u) \approx 1 + \frac{\alpha}{u}
$$

This is the **constitutive law**: in PNP, the effective propagation index $n$ increases as the local energy density $u$ decreases. No external postulate is made; it follows from the $O(\epsilon^2)$ term in the expansion.

## 5 Stationary spherical halo setup

Let a baryonic bulge of radius $R_b$ have a measured luminosity/mass profile. Its stationary scalar field $U_b$ generates both:

- A weak **radial** energy flux $\langle S_r\rangle>0$,
- A dominant **tangential** circulating energy flow $\mathbf S_\perp$.

We decompose:

$$
\mathbf S = S_r(r)\,\hat r + \mathbf S_\perp(r)
$$

and

$$
u = u_\perp + \sigma_r, \quad
u_\perp = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E_\perp^2 + c^2B_\perp^2),\quad
\sigma_r = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E_r^2 + c^2B_r^2).
$$

Dominant tangential energy means $u_\perp\gg\sigma_r$.

## 6 Flux continuity

Stationarity $\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf S=0$ implies:

$$
\frac{d}{dr}\big(r^2 S_r\big) = 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad S_r(r) = \frac{K}{4\pi r^2}
$$

where $K$ is fixed by the interior bulge field through continuity at $R_b$:

$$
K = 4\pi R_b^2 S_r(R_b^+) = 4\pi R_b^2 S_r(R_b^-)
$$

---

## 7 Linking $u(r)$ and $n(u)$

The radial flux is also $S_r = v_g(u)\,u$ with $v_g(u) = c/n(u)$, hence:

$$
u(r)\,r^2 = K\,n(u(r))
$$

Using the derived $n(u) \approx 1 + \alpha/u$:

$$
u r^2 = K\left(1 + \frac{\alpha}{u}\right)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
u^2 r^2 - K u - \alpha K = 0
$$

---

## 8 Solving for $u(r)$

The positive root is:

$$
u(r) = \frac{K + \sqrt{K^2 + 4\alpha K r^2}}{2\,r^2}
$$

Asymptotics:

- **Small $r$:** $u \sim K/r^2$ (Newtonian-like).
- **Large $r$:** $u \sim \sqrt{\alpha K}/r$.

## 9 Tangential stress and acceleration

From Maxwell stress:

$$
T_{rr} \approx -u_\perp \approx -u
$$

Radial acceleration on a test $U$-knot of size $a$ and energy $E_\star$:

$$
a_r(r) \propto T_{rr}(r) \propto -u(r)
$$

Thus:

$$
a_r(r) \propto -\frac{\sqrt{\alpha K}}{r} \quad\Rightarrow\quad v^2(r) = r|a_r(r)| = \text{const}
$$

Flat rotation curves follow naturally.

---

## 10 Discussion

We have:

1. **No new matter fields** — the halo is a configuration of the same scalar $U$.
2. **No empirical force modification** — the $n(u)$ law is derived from PNP’s $O(\epsilon^2)$ term.
3. **Prediction** — given the measured bulge profile, $K$ is fixed; $u(r)$ and $v(r)$ follow.

Thus astronomical rotation curves are a direct test of PNP’s gravitational sector.

## Appendix A: Mode-geometry factor $\alpha$

In the expansion, $\alpha$ is:

$$
\alpha = \gamma_2\,\chi
$$

where $\gamma_2$ is the $O(\epsilon^2)$ coefficient from the envelope equation, and $\chi$ is a geometric factor from the TE$_{11}$ mode structure in the $(n_1,n_2) = (1,1)$ torus. Both are computable from the base PNP mode geometry.
