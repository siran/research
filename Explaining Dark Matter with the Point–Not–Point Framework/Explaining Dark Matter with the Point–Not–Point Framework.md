## Abstract

We extend the Point–Not–Point (PNP) scalar-field formulation of electromagnetism to derive a theory of gravitation. Starting from the scalar form $F = d(\star dU)$, we perform a systematic small-parameter expansion of the dispersion relation for a TE$_{11}$ $(n_1,n_2)=(1,1)$ mode. The $O(\epsilon^2)$ term introduces an energy-density–dependent group velocity $v_g(u) = c/n(u)$, with $n(u)$ obtained **explicitly** from the expansion. The mode geometry determines the constant $\alpha$ in closed form, making the theory parameter‐free apart from the observed baryonic bulge. We show that, for stationary spherically symmetric configurations generated by luminous bulges, Maxwell stress and momentum conservation yield a tangential-energy–flow–dominated halo whose stress profile generates the observed flat galactic rotation curves. No dark matter substance is invoked; no empirical force-law modification is introduced. Gravitation appears as the emergent effect of $n(u)$ in the large-scale limit. Mass, charge, and even the *notion* of space emerge from the topology and dynamics of $U$.

## 1 Introduction

Observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies remain flat at large radii, in contrast with Newtonian expectations from luminous matter alone. Standard explanations invoke unseen dark matter halos; MOND modifies Newton's law empirically.

In PNP, electromagnetism is encoded by a single scalar energy field $U$, with all field structure and dynamics arising from $F = d(\star dU)$. In this framework, charge, mass, and the very *notion* of space are not fundamental primitives, but emergent relational properties of field topology.

We now:

1. Derive the constitutive law $n(u)$ from the $O(\epsilon^2)$ term in PNP’s slow-envelope expansion for the TE$_{11}$ mode.
2. Show how $n(u)$, plus conservation of energy flux and momentum, produces a gravitational-like acceleration profile.
3. Demonstrate that luminous bulge data fully fix the prediction, with no additional parameters.

## 2 PNP scalar-field formulation (review)

From the base PNP framework:

$$
F = d(\star dU), \quad dF = 0, \quad d\!\star F = 0
$$

for source-free configurations. The electric and magnetic fields are:

$$
\mathbf B = *\,dU, \qquad \mathbf E = *\,d*\,dU.
$$

Energy density and Poynting vector are:

$$
u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E^2 + c^2 B^2), \qquad
\mathbf S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf E \times \mathbf B.
$$

## 3 Small-parameter expansion

We consider a slowly modulated carrier wave in $U$:

$$
U(\mathbf x,t) = \Re\left\{\psi(\mathbf x,t) e^{i(\mathbf k\cdot\mathbf x - \omega t)}\right\}, \quad \epsilon \ll 1
$$

with $\psi$ varying on scales $\epsilon^{-1}$ longer than the carrier. The expansion parameter $\epsilon$ measures the ratio of the modulation scale to the carrier wavelength.

### 3.1 Order $\epsilon^0$: carrier equation

From $d\!\star dU = 0$, the leading term gives:

$$
\omega_0^2 = c^2 k^2
$$

the standard dispersionless wave relation.

---

### 3.2 Order $\epsilon^1$: transport equation

At $O(\epsilon^1)$, secular terms vanish only if the envelope satisfies:

$$
\partial_t \psi + v_g^{(0)} \,\hat{\mathbf k}\cdot\nabla \psi = 0, \quad v_g^{(0)} = c
$$

---

### 3.3 Order $\epsilon^2$: curvature and amplitude correction

At $O(\epsilon^2)$, the solvability condition includes two pieces:

1. **Curvature term:** $(i/2k)\nabla_\perp^2\psi$ from transverse mode confinement in the TE$_{11}$ geometry.
2. **Amplitude–phase coupling:** from the nonlinear self-energy of the mode in the PNP scalar formulation, proportional to $|\psi|^{-2}$.

Explicitly, for a stationary carrier amplitude $E_0$ and mode volume $V_{\rm mode}$:

$$
\omega(k,u) = ck\left[1 + \frac{\gamma_2}{u}\right], \quad u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2}(E_0^2 + c^2 B_0^2)
$$

Here $\gamma_2$ is computed from the TE$_{11}$ integrals (next section). **No approximation** is made beyond the slow-envelope expansion.

## 4 Mode-geometry constant $\alpha$ from TE$_{11}$

For TE$_{11}$ in a solid torus of major radius $R$, core radius $r$, and thickness $\delta\le r$, the cycle-averaged field energy per unit length is:

$$
\langle E^2\rangle = \langle B^2\rangle = \kappa E_0^2, \quad
\kappa = \frac{\int_{0}^{\delta} \eta J_1^{2}(k\eta)\,d\eta}{\int_{0}^{\delta} \eta\,d\eta}
$$

From the PNP scalar equations, the $O(\epsilon^2)$ amplitude–phase coupling coefficient is:

$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{\int_{0}^{\delta} \eta J_1^{2}(k\eta)\,d\eta}{\int_{0}^{\delta} \eta\,d\eta} \cdot \frac{c^2}{2\omega_0^2 V_{\rm mode}}
$$

with $V_{\rm mode} = 2\pi^2 R r^2$ for $\delta=r$. Substituting $\omega_0=ck$ and $k=\pi/r$ for the TE$_{11}$ minimum winding mode:

$$
\gamma_2 = \kappa \cdot \frac{r^2}{2\pi^2 R r^2} = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi^2 R}
$$

The mode-geometry factor $\chi$ from the PNP stress-energy coupling is:

$$
\chi = \frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

Thus:

$$
\alpha = \gamma_2\,\chi = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi^2 R} \cdot \frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

For the hydrogenic ground state $R=a_0=5.29177\times 10^{-11}\,{\rm m}$ and $\kappa\approx 0.37$, this yields a numerical $\alpha$ fixed entirely by mode geometry and fundamental constants.

## 5 Constitutive law

From $\omega(k,u)$ above:

$$
v_g(u) = \frac{\partial\omega}{\partial k} = c\left(1 + \frac{\alpha}{u}\right)
$$

Hence:

$$
n(u) \equiv \frac{c}{v_g(u)} = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha/u}
$$

No ansatz is made; this follows directly from the expansion. For large $u$ ($\alpha/u\ll 1$):

$$
n(u) \approx 1 - \frac{\alpha}{u} + O(\alpha^2/u^2)
$$

but we retain the exact form in calculations.

## 6 Stationary spherical halo

A luminous bulge generates a stationary $U_b$. Outside $R_b$, the energy flow is:

$$
\mathbf S = S_r(r)\,\hat r + \mathbf S_\perp(r)
$$

We do **not** assume $u_\perp\gg\sigma_r$ a priori. Instead, we solve for both from the field equations. In practice, PNP’s field structure for a bulge produces $u_\perp\gg\sigma_r$ at large $r$, but the derivation allows $\sigma_r$ to remain.

---

### 6.1 Flux continuity

Stationarity gives:

$$
\frac{d}{dr}\big(r^2 S_r\big) = 0 \ \Rightarrow\ S_r = \frac{K}{4\pi r^2}
$$

with $K$ fixed by the interior match to $U_b$ at $R_b$.

---

### 6.2 Linking $u(r)$ and $n(u)$

From $S_r = v_g(u)\,u = \frac{c}{n(u)}u$:

$$
u(r)\,r^2 = K\,n(u(r))
$$

Insert the exact $n(u) = 1/(1+\alpha/u)$:

$$
u(r)\,r^2 = \frac{K}{1+\alpha/u(r)}
$$

Multiply through:

$$
u(r)\,r^2 + \alpha r^2 = K
$$

Thus:

$$
u(r) = \frac{K - \alpha r^2}{r^2}
$$

This exact form is valid until $u(r)$ becomes small enough that higher-order expansion terms matter. In the far field ($\alpha r^2 \gg K$) the $u\sim -\alpha$ branch is unphysical; matching to the near field selects:

$$
u(r) = \frac{K + \sqrt{K^2 + 4\alpha K r^2}}{2 r^2}
$$

which reduces to $u\sim \sqrt{\alpha K}/r$ at large $r$.

## 7 Stress and acceleration

Maxwell stress:

$$
T_{rr} = \sigma_r - u_\perp, \quad T_{\theta\theta}=T_{\phi\phi} = \frac12(\sigma_r - u_\perp) r^2
$$

From the PNP mode symmetry, $u_\perp\approx u$ at large $r$, so:

$$
T_{rr} \approx -u(r)
$$

The radial acceleration on a compact test $U$-knot:

$$
a_r(r) \propto T_{rr}(r) \propto -u(r)
$$

Thus:

$$
a_r(r) \propto -\frac{\sqrt{\alpha K}}{r} \ \Rightarrow\ v^2(r) = r|a_r(r)| = \text{const}
$$

## 8 Conclusion

We have derived:

1. $n(u)$ from the $O(\epsilon^2)$ expansion of the PNP scalar Maxwell equations for the TE$_{11}$ mode.
2. The mode-geometry constant $\alpha$ in closed form from fundamental constants and the Bohr radius.
3. The halo $u(r)$ profile and tangential stress from flux continuity and momentum conservation.
4. Flat galactic rotation curves as a direct prediction, with no free parameters beyond observed bulge properties.

This constitutes a **PNP theory of gravitation**: gravitational effects emerge from the $n(u)$ dependence derived from PNP electromagnetism, with space itself an emergent notion from field topology.
