## Abstract
A measurement becomes part of shared reality only after its outcome decoheres—that is, after the information has been copied into a large set of uncontrolled microstates. We propose that an *unconscious* decision not to engage with a nascent stimulus can prevent that stimulus from decohering. Unconscious control therefore functions as a natural, endogenous programmable collapse filter (PCF), regulating which potential events crystallise into awareness.

## One-Sentence Summary
Unconscious control can act as an internal collapse filter, stopping neural micro-events from decohering into classical awareness.

## Keywords
finite-bath decoherence, unconscious veto, programmable collapse filter, neural threshold, Maxwell ontology

## 1 Conceptual Framework
Classical measurement requires copying an outcome into the environment, thereby forming a classical record. If a stimulus is prevented from entering awareness, its branch never decoheres and remains physically reversible. Because the non-chosen branch does not decohere, it is never experienced.

## 2 Discussion
This framework implies that the faster layer of unconscious control—rather than deliberative “free will”—selects which micro-events are allowed to decohere. Training practices that refine this control should influence which potential futures become part of shared awareness.
