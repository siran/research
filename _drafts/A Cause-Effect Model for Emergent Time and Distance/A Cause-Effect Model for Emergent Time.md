## One-Sentence Summary

Time and distance emerge from cause-effect ordering among subnodes within a single stable Node.


## Abstract

Reality emerges from one stable Node with incomputable internal structure. Subnodes interact and form cause-effect relations. The partial ordering of these relations acts as time. Counting the minimal causal steps needed for a subnode to affect another defines distance. When access is indirect, a round-trip loop inside the same subnode builds a clock and a notion of distance. This scheme shows how space, time, and measurement can arise from internal interactions of a stable underlying structure.


## Keywords

emergent time, emergent distance, cause-effect, causal ordering, measurement


## Introduction

Conventional physics assumes external space and time. Here the starting point is a single, indivisible Node **N**. N is globally unchanging in total energy. Inside N exist subnodes with rich structure and causal links. Time is the observed ordering of cause and effect. Distance is the number of causal steps needed for a subnode $i$ to affect subnode $j$.



## Stable Node and Internal Structure

Let

$$
\mathbf{N} = \{ n_i \mid i \in I \}
$$

represent the full Node. Total energy never changes. Locally, subnodes influence each other. If subnode $n_i$ triggers a change in $n_j$:

$$
n_i \succ n_j
$$

meaning $n_i$ causes $n_j$. The relation is partial and not necessarily symmetric. Chains like $n_i \succ n_a \succ n_b \succ n_j$ define a sequence of events. This ordering is emergent time.


## Constructing a Clock

A single subnode $n_i$ can define a clock cycle:

1. $n_i$ creates a perturbation.
2. The perturbation propagates through some chain of subnodes.
3. The effect returns to $n_i$, closing the loop.

Counting discrete causal steps gives a repeatable “tick.” A direct link $n_i \succ n_j$ is one step. Longer paths add more steps.


## Emergent Distance

Distance between $n_i$ and $n_j$ is proportional to the minimal causal chain length:

$$
d(n_i, n_j) \propto L_{ij}
$$

where $L_{ij} = 1$ for direct adjacency and larger if intermediaries exist.
If no path exists, distance is undefined or effectively infinite.
If $n_j$ is unreachable, a round-trip inside $n_i$ still gives a measurable count of causal steps, providing an indirect sense of distance.


## Reflections and Chains

Signals may travel directly, pass through intermediaries, or reflect back to their source. Each segment is a cause-effect step. Summing steps yields duration and effective distance. Even complex paths remain countable.


## Discussion

The Node stays globally stable. Only internal patterns of cause-effect change. Time and distance are operational: clocks come from loops, and distances from causal step counts. Standard physics measures by signals and propagation delays. This framework generalizes that idea inside an abstract Node with no external spacetime assumed.


## Conclusion

A single stable Node with incomputable structure can generate emergent time and distance. Cause-effect partial ordering gives time. Counting causal steps gives distance. Clocks are loops of cause-effect inside subnodes. Measurement of time and space follows from internal logic alone.
