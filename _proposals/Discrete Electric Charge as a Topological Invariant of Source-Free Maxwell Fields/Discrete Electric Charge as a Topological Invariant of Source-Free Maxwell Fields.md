# Discrete Electric Charge as a Topological Invariant of Source-Free Maxwell Fields

### Abstract (<=120 words)

State that a pair of integer windings $Q=(n_{1},n_{2})\in\pi_{1}(T^{2})\cong\mathbb Z^{2}$ reproduces the observed discreteness of electron charge without sources: each winding contributes a fixed flux quantum; stable field lines force integer multiples. Quantised Coulomb energy emerges from mode geometry, not from Gauss-law sources.

### Skeleton

1. **Motivation** – experimental charge quantisation; limitations of source-based explanations.
2. **Geometry of a toroidal vacuum mode** – radii $(R,r)$, harmonic forms, definition of $Q$.
3. **Topological theorem** – smooth Maxwell evolution preserves $Q$; sketch homotopy proof.
4. **Flux quantisation** – each unit of $Q$ carries flux $\Phi_{0}$; derive from Stokes + single-valued vector potential.
5. **Mapping to the electron** – match $\Phi_{0}$ with $\alpha$ (fine-structure) to fix $R/r$.
6. **Observable predictions** – (i) half-integer anomalies forbidden; (ii) allowed annihilation channels require $\Delta Q=0$; list spectroscopic tests.
7. **Discussion** – relation to Dirac monopole quantisation and $\theta$-vacua; why no free parameters remain.


## Notes

* Keep “light-based metric” as a practical ruler only; emphasise metric-free statements of observables.
* Cite prior “energy–energy attraction” derivation and clearly state when that argument is reused.
* Append detailed proofs or numerical code; main text stays lean, \~6–8 pages each.

These outlines isolate the two messages you want: **(I) charge quantisation from topology, (II) inverse-square attraction from energy**, making the conceptual difference unmistakable.
