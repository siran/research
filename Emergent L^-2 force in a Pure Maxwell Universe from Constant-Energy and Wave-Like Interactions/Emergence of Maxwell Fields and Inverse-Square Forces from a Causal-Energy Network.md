  abstract: |
  We present a formal derivation of how Maxwell's equations in vacuum, quantized atomic structure, and gravitational-like inverse-square forces emerge naturally within a causally structured, energy-conserving node framework. Time and distance arise from cause-effect chains among subnodes in a stable background node. Once embedded into a continuous manifold by internal observers, experimental abstraction of electromagnetic laws yields Maxwell's equations. Quantized matter, inertial mass, and long-range attraction follow from field coherence and standing-wave constraints. Gravity is reinterpreted as energy-density-induced modulation of wave speed, not spacetime curvature. The framework provides a consistent, emergent, and minimal foundation for classical fields, quantization, and geometry.

## 1. Introduction

We consider a model where reality emerges from a single, indivisible **Node** $N$, internally composed of causally interacting **subnodes** $\{n_i\}$. There is no background space or time; instead:

* **Time** emerges from the partial ordering $n_i \succ n_j$.
* **Distance** emerges by counting causal steps.
* **Observers within the node**, by performing internal experiments, recover Maxwell's equations and associated physical laws.

Our goal: show how classical electromagnetic behavior, matter quantization, and gravitational-like forces emerge as experimental abstractions inside this structure.

## 2. Causal Network and Emergent Observables

### 2.1 Cause-Effect Ordering

Define $n_i \succ n_j$ if a change in subnode $n_i$ triggers a change in $n_j$. This defines a **partial order**, the basis of time.

### 2.2 Distance via Causal Chain Length

Let $L_{ij}$ be the minimal number of steps in a causal chain from $n_i$ to $n_j$. Define:
$d(n_i, n_j) \propto L_{ij}.$

### 2.3 Emergent Space and Embedding

Subnodes form a graph with causal distances $d(n_i, n_j)$. If large subsets embed in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with low distortion, space appears 3D.

## 3. Experimental Abstraction: Emergence of Maxwell Fields

Any observer within this causal subnode space can construct **clocks** and **rods** from cyclic cause-effect loops. From repeated experiments with signals and interactions, they reconstruct:

$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = 0, \quad \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0, \quad \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\partial_t \vec{B}, \quad \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \partial_t \vec{E}.$

These are abstracted **Maxwell vacuum laws**—universally observed because they describe the large-scale behavior of causal-energy flow.

## 4. Quantized Matter from Toroidal Standing Waves

### 4.1 Topological Energy Modes

Energy confined in a toroidal topology with radii $R, r$ supports standing waves with winding numbers $n_1, n_2$. Coherence requires:
$\lambda_1 = 2\pi R / n_1, \quad \lambda_2 = 2\pi r / n_2.$

### 4.2 Energy Quantization

Lowest mode: $n_1 = n_2 = 1$. Higher modes:
$E_{n} = E_0 / n^2,$
matches Rydberg formula without invoking charge or mass.

### 4.3 Mass as Field Inertia

Stable circulation of electromagnetic energy resists acceleration. Mass emerges from internal **momentum flux**, not as fundamental substance.

## 5. Gravity from Energy Density: Light Speed as Local Function

From Maxwell’s wave equation:
$c(x) = 1/\sqrt{\mu(x)\varepsilon(x)}.$
Increased energy density (from compressed matter) modifies $\mu, \varepsilon$, reducing $c$. This **mimics curvature**:

* Light bends due to spatial variation in $c(x)$.
* Redshift arises from local field energy differences.

No spacetime curvature is invoked. Gravitational effects result from the dielectric nature of clustered electromagnetic energy.

## 6. Inverse-Square Force from Standing-Wave Confinement

Two energy lumps at distance $r$ support standing-wave modes. Energy of mode $m$:
$W_m(r) \propto \frac{1}{r}.$

Total energy is conserved. Differentiating:
$F(r) = -\frac{dW}{dr} \propto -\frac{1}{r^2}.$

Thus, inverse-square attraction arises from **wave geometry and energy conservation**, not mass.

## 7. Interpretation and Coherence

* Observers abstract Maxwell fields from internal cause-effect patterns.
* Matter quantization and inertia emerge from stable energy loops.
* Gravity is a **light-speed modulation** from local energy density.
* $1/r^2$ attraction arises from standing-wave energy slope.

All physical law becomes **emergent structure** on a stable, energy-conserving causal network.

## 8. Conclusion

We have shown that within a causal-energy network with no external spacetime:

* Maxwell's equations emerge from experimental abstraction.
* Quantized matter and mass arise from coherent field configurations.
* Gravity results from electromagnetic dielectric gradients.
* Inverse-square forces follow from wave energy constraints.

This provides a minimal, complete, emergent foundation for classical field theory and the structure of matter.
